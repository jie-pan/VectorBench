environment variables to set

mandatory - if building and want to use pre-built clang
COMP_SRC_DIR - where llvm srcs are to be downloaded / or are already downloaded
COMP_BUILD_DIR - where llvm should be build / or where it is already built

optional - for automatically building llvm
COMP_BUILD = 1/0 - this builds llvm using the environment variables above - default 0
COMP_GENERATE = 1/0 - if COMP_BUILD = 1; this can be used to control whether CMake should be run again - default 1
COMP_VERSION = Release or debug - if generate is not 0 then this would be used to build the specified version of the project - default Release

config files for spec2006 and spec2017 are in vec/config copy them to the spec installation directory config locations if you want to use them,
if you are using clang built by this utility then you have to use clang versions of the config files we provide and modify them accordingly

steps

1. Download the repo
2. Download the relevant benchmarks - which are not included
   
	spec2006 - not included - install it in vec/spec2006-install - mac-gcc.cfg used as the config change it in the run.sh file
	spec2017 - not included - install it in vec/spec2017-install - mac-gcc.cfg used as the config change it in the run.sh file
	simd - included
	nas - included - remember to create the bin directory though

3. compile and run the benchmarks - you can build llvm or point to clang that is already built
   use run.sh for this (./run.sh <suite> <bench>)
   
   if building llvm in benchmarks folder
      *COMP_SRC_DIR=<src> COMP_BUILD_DIR=<build> COMP_BUILD=1 COMP_GENERATE=1 ./run.sh <suite> <bench>
      *This would ask you to place CPLEX binaries in the correct place. Download and place CPLEX in COMP_SRC_DIR/libraries/cplex and remember to strip
       platform info from x86_64* folders (e.g., rename x86_64_linux to x86_64)
      *COMP_SRC_DIR=<src> COMP_BUILD_DIR=<build> COMP_BUILD=1 ./run.sh <suite> <bench>
   else
      *COMP_SRC_DIR=<src> COMP_BUILD_DIR=<build> ./run.sh <suite> <bench>

   for nightly builds and tests use COMP_BUILD=1 and COMP_GENERATE=1
   suites - vec, revec
   bench
	vec - spec2006, spec2017, nas
	revec - simd

  when running spec2006 or spec2017 please specify the config files using SPEC2006_CONFIG / SPEC2017_CONFIG env variables.
